# model-selection-for-epidemic-renewal-models
Uses accumulated prediction error (APE) to select among renewal model formulations 

Renewal models [1, 2] estimate the effective reproduction number, R(t), underyling observed outbreaks. They use incidence data (time series of infected cases) to infer a piecewise-constant approximation to R(t). The quality of this estimate is highly dependent on the size of a smoothing window (k) that is employed. This code presents a method for optimally selecting k in a manner that balances reliable R(t) estimation with short-term forecasts of incidence. This method is based on the accumulated prediction error (APE) idea from information theory [3].

The main code is in the m files denoted ape_ or batch_ and examines various epidemic examples using APE. The m files draw on data from the EpiEstim package in R [2] and are responsible for all figures and results in [4]. Figures and results are in the accompanying folders.
